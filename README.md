# Scientific Mdx Template

Template for writing scientific papers in [mdx](https://mdxjs.com/) and friends.

## Motivation

* Separation of concerns between content (mdx) of the paper and the layout (css) of the paper.
* CSS is easier to hack for changes in styling.
* Allows reuse of the content of the paper for different formats (e.g. webpage, app, GitHub Readme).
* HTML handles SVG better than Latex.
* Allows rendering of plots directly from data.
